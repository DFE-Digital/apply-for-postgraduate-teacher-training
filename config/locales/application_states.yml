      description: |
        When a candidate has filled in their email address, they’ve started an
        application. Until they submit their application to a provider, it is
        in the unsubmitted state. The providers don’t see the application at this stage.

    awaiting_references:
      name: Awaiting references
      description: |
        Applicants submit their application choices with list of referees. Until 2 references have been received the application remains at the Awaiting References state.
        The providers don’t see the application at this stage.

    application_complete:
      name: Waiting to be sent
      description: |
        After the references have come back and have been added to the application.
        The providers don’t see the application at this stage in order to give
        candidates a fixed period of 5 days to modify their application. They can't
        modify the references.

    awaiting_provider_decision:
      name: Awaiting provider decision
      description: |
        The providers only see the application after the references have come back
        and have been added to the application and 5 days have elapsed for
        the candidate to review and modify the application.

        When both of these prerequisites are met the application moves to the
        Awaiting provider decision state.

    offer:
      name: Offer made
      description: |
        A provider makes an offer to the candidate. The candidate then has to accept
        or reject the offer, which sets the application status to 'Pending
        conditions'.

        We assume that all offers have some conditions, even if there
        are no academic conditions.

    recruited:
      name: Recruited
      description: |
        If the candidate has met all conditions of their offer, the provider marks
        their application as 'recruited'.

    enrolled:
      name: Candidate enrolled
      description: |
        Once a candidate has completed the enrolment process, the provider confirms
        their enrolment onto the training programme. Since this status would be used
        to claim bursaries/grants from DfE, the provider may delay enrolling the trainee
        until a few weeks after the start of the training, since trainees can still
        not show up on the first day or drop out within the first couple of weeks.
        This reduces the risk that DfE over-pays that provider for training they didn’t
        deliver and having to reconcile later on.
