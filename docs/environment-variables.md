# Environment Variables

**NOTE: Environment variables should not start with *endpoint*, *input*, *secret*, or *securefile* (irrespective of capitalisation) due to them being protected variable names within the Azure DevOps environment.** If this cannot be avoided variable mapping will have to be used, but wherever possible it is simpler not to use these protected names.

Environment variables have to be defined in several places depending upon where they are required, some are common to both local development and the Azure hosted deployment, while others are specific to the environments they relate, all of which are described below

## Dockerfile

If an environment variable is required during the Docker image build, like for example in the Rails asset compilation process, these should be defined in the Dockerfile in the following format.

`ENV VARIABLE_NAME=Value`

When defining variables in the Dockerfile use dummy values for security reasons since they will be committed to Git and they will ultimately be overriden by docker-compose when you launch a container using the image.

## Local Development

If an environment variable is required for use in the local development environment it should be declared in the .env file in the following format

`VARIABLE_NAME=Value`

The [.env.example](../.env.example) file contains the essential environment variables that must exist for local development builds to succeed.

## Docker Compose

For docker compose to make the necessary environment variables available in the container at run time they must be declared in the relevant docker-compose.yaml file, of which there are three.

* [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) - Variables that are required for local dev and the docker image build phase in azure only should be defined the *environment* section in this file. This will in general only be for the database.
* [docker-compose.azure.yml](../docker-compose.azure.yml) - This file is used in the Azure devops pipeline. Any environment variables required during build/deployment need to be declared in the *environment* section of this file. **You should only declare the environment variable here, not its value.** The only exception to this is where we need to map variables due to the use of protected variable names, e.g. Rails SECRET_KEY_BASE.

## Azure Hosting (DevOps pipeline)

These steps describe the process for making environment variables available to the the Azure DevOps pipeline.

1. Declare the desired variable in the appropriate "variable group" in the Library section of the Azure DevOps site (https://dfe-ssp.visualstudio.com/Become-A-Teacher/_library?itemType=VariableGroups). All variable groups related to apply are suffixed as such and there is a variable group per deployment environment.
2. Add your variable with the same name in all the 5(DevOps, QA, Staging, Sandbox, Production) variable groups.
3. In [deploy.yml](../azure/pipelines/templates/deploy.yml#L191) make the following additions:
   1. In the Azure Resource Group deployment task *overrideParameters* section add your variable in the format `-varName: "$(varName)"`
4. In [azure/template.json](../azure/template.json) make the following additions:
   1. Duplicate this block of code for your new variable at the end of the *parameters* section.
      ```json
      "varName": {
        "type": "string",
        "metadata": {
          "description": "Describe your variable here."
        }
      }
      ```
   2. Around [line 500](../azure/template.json#L505) duplicate this block of code in the *appEnvironmentVariables* parameter of the `app-service-and-containers` resource and configure it to match your new environment varaible.
   If the environment variable in question is a secret, change `value` to `secureValue`.
      ```json
      {
        "name": "ENV_VAR_NAME",
        "value": "[parameters('varName')]"
      }
      ```
   The values asigned to `appEnvironmentVariables` will be available as environment variables in the web app, clock and worker container instances.
