    <p class="govuk-body">Teacher training providers need to check that it’s safe for you to work with children and young people.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">As well as confirming your identity and your right to work in the UK, providers will check:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your criminal record in the UK (they'll do an enhanced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about#dbs-checks" class="govuk-link">DBS check)</a> and abroad where relevant</li>
      <li>whether you’ve been banned from teaching or working with children</li>
      <li>your professional behaviour, such as whether you’ve been removed from teacher training and what your referees say about you</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">Tell your provider about any potential safeguarding issues, such as offences, cautions, reprimands and final warnings. They can give advice about whether this will affect your application.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">It won’t necessarily stop you becoming a teacher.</p>
