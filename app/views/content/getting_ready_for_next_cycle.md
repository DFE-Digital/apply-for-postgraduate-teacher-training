The last date on which training providers will receive applications for the current cycle (2019 to 2020).

Training providers must respond to all outstanding applications by 23.59pm on 3 October – all applications without a response will be rejected automatically.

### Mid-October 2020
The next training cycle (2020 to 2021) opens. We’ll inform you of the exact date nearer the time.

## How we’re planning for a smooth transition

The [Apply for teacher training](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.education.gov.uk/candidate) and [Manage teacher training applications](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.education.gov.uk/provider) teams are putting plans in place for a smooth transition from the current training cycle to the next.

Training providers can be confident that:

* all courses that were on [Apply for teacher training](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.education.gov.uk/candidate) – and any new courses you create on [Publish teacher training](https://interactions.signin.education.gov.uk//cc4ac56f-35a9-4ec9-ae67-f0a1f5873db4/usernamepassword?clientid=bats2&redirect_uri=https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/auth/dfe/callback) courses – will be available on Apply for the next cycle, unless you tell us otherwise
* providers will be able to defer offers to candidates
* application data will be stored and remain accessible in the next cycle
* we’ll do all we can to help with data reporting


We’ve covered these features in more detail below.

For help and to give feedback at any time, contact us on [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk).


## Course rollover

Our colleagues in [Publish teacher training courses](https://interactions.signin.education.gov.uk//cc4ac56f-35a9-4ec9-ae67-f0a1f5873db4/usernamepassword?clientid=bats2&redirect_uri=https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/auth/dfe/callback) will, as usual, carry your courses over from this cycle to the next so they appear on [Find postgraduate teacher training](https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk/) in time for the opening of the 2020 to 2021 cycle in mid-October.

(You should have an email from Publish with details about course rollover. Please get in touch with us on [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk) if you have not received it.)

All courses that were on Apply this cycle – and any new courses you create on [Publish teacher training courses](https://interactions.signin.education.gov.uk//cc4ac56f-35a9-4ec9-ae67-f0a1f5873db4/usernamepassword?clientid=bats2&redirect_uri=https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/auth/dfe/callback) – will be available on Apply for the next cycle, unless you tell us otherwise.

We’ll write to you again at the beginning of the next cycle to confirm your courses are going live on Apply for teaching training, so you’ll have the opportunity to make changes at this stage.


## Closing the cycle

DfE will close the current recruitment cycle on 3 October 2020. If your courses are full before that date, you are of course free to close your recruitment cycle earlier. You can do this by closing your courses on Find postgraduate teacher training using Publish teacher training courses.


Training providers will need to respond to all outstanding applications by this date – any applications you have not responded to will be rejected automatically.


## Deferring offers

The Manage teacher training applications team is working on a new feature allowing training providers to defer offers to the next cycle.

Deferrals must come at the request of the candidate.

You can:
* defer any offer that has been accepted by a candidate
* defer at any point in the cycle
* defer with conditions ‘pending’ or ‘met’

When the 2020 to 2021 cycle opens in mid-October, you’ll be guided through the process of checking and confirming deferred offers.

If you need to alter any details of the offer – for example, the location, course or conditions – you should explain and agree any changes with the candidate directly via email or phone.

You can then use the service to send an amended offer to the candidate, who will also receive a formal notification.

For the purposes of data reporting, deferred offers will not appear as rejected offers in the current cycle.  This will ensure you are able to submit accurate figures for rejections in each cycle.



If you have to withdraw a deferred offer and cannot provide the candidate with an alternative, please contact us immediately on [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk).


## Storing and carrying over application data

By the end of November 2020, training providers will have access to and be able to search application data relating to:


* the previous cycle (2019 to 2020)
* the current cycle (2020 to 2021)
* the next cycle (for example, offers you defer to 2021 and to 2022)

Your notes and actions, including reasons for rejection, will be stored along with the application data so you can easily refer to them.


## Data reporting

We understand that data reporting to both DTTP and HESA can be time-consuming.

We’re now developing a feature allowing training providers to download their application data as a csv file. This should make this process easier – however we’ll continue to work on further improvements, and welcome all feedback.


## Helping candidates apply again

Where possible, candidates who were unsuccessful in the current cycle are strongly encouraged to apply again, through:


* constructive feedback from training providers using the Manage teacher training service
* supportive communications from the Apply for teacher training support team
* allowing candidates to save and carry over their applications from the current cycle to the next


## UCAS Teacher Training

On UCAS, candidates will have slightly longer (until 6 September 2020) to submit applications to training providers before the cycle closes. We’ll let candidates know about this.

More generally, UCAS will continue to run alongside Apply for teacher training for the 2020 to 2021 cycle.

For the 2021 to 2022 cycle, Apply for teacher training will process all teacher training applications to all teacher training providers in England.

Check [Using the Manage teacher training applications service](https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.education.gov.uk/provider/service-guidance) for more about the dual running of these 2 services.
