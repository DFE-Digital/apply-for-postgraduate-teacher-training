Thank you for using Apply for teacher training, a service run by the Department for Education.

Using Apply for teacher training means you agree to these terms of use.

## How to apply for teacher training courses

### Stage 1: submitting your initial application

You can apply for up to 3 courses across Apply for teacher training and [UCAS Teacher Training](https://www.ucas.com/teaching-in-the-uk).

**You can only accept 1 offer**, even if you use both services.

You can not apply for the same course on both services.

### Stage 2: trying again if your application was not successful

You can apply for another course at this stage if you do not get an offer or if you choose not to accept your offer(s).

[Get Into Teaching](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/get-help-and-support) can guide you through the process of applying for more courses. Contact them for free on 0800 389 2500, or [chat to an adviser using the online chat service](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/lp/live-chat).

### Making changes to your application

Get in touch with us as soon as possible after submitting your application if you need to make any amends, as we only have 5 working days to make changes for you.

For example, you can add more courses (if you haven’t reached your limit of 3) or change your course choices.

Once we’ve processed your request, we will not be able to make any more changes for you.

However, you can ask us to amend your name or contact details at any point up until enrolment.

Contact us at <becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk> if you need to make changes.

### Withdrawing your application

You can withdraw your application to your course(s) at any point, even after you’ve accepted an offer.

[Sign in to your account](/candidate/sign-in) and click ‘withdraw’ next to the course(s) you want to withdraw.

## How we check your suitability for working with children

All candidates must have an enhanced DBS check. This will show up any spent or unspent criminal convictions.

Not all convictions will stop you from teaching. [Talk to your provider about their policy on criminal convictions](https://www.gov.uk/exoffenders-and-employment).

Your name will also be checked against a DBS list of people who have been barred from working with children.
