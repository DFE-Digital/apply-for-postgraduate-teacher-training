We recognise that training providers continue to work under very difficult conditions. We previously announced that we will not reject or decline any offers automatically until 20 April 2020. **We’ve now extended that date to 31 May 2020**.

Below we outline what this means for you and your candidates. We’ll keep you updated if anything else changes.

## Giving you more time before applications are rejected by default (RBD)

### Applications that have been submitted already

You have until 23:59 on 31 May to make decisions on applications which would normally be automatically rejected on or before 31 May.

For applications which have a RBD date after 31 May, you’ll also have more time to make a decision. We’ll add an extra 6 weeks to the response deadlines.

### Applications that are submitted between now and 31 May

If applications come in between now and 31 May, you have until 23:59 on 24 July to respond. No applications in this category will be automatically rejected until then.

### How to keep track of your new RBD dates

You can see your new RBD dates in [Manage teacher training applications](/provider/applications).

### Keeping candidates up to date

We’ll let candidates know that it might take you longer to respond to their application, and tell them your new RBD date.

## Giving candidates more time to make decisions on offers

### Hearing back from candidates might take longer

We’re pausing all automatic decline by default (DBD) dates until 31 May. This means that there may be a delay hearing back from any candidates who would normally have to respond to an offer on or before 31 May. We’re giving everyone in this category until 23:59 on 31 May to respond.

There may also be a delay hearing back from candidates who have a DBD date after 31 May. For example, if you made the offer before 31 May, a candidate will have a bit more time than the usual 10 days to respond because we’re pausing the system until 31 May.

### How to keep track of candidates’ new DBD dates

You can find candidates’ new DBD dates in [Manage teacher training applications](/provider/applications).

### Keeping candidates up to date

We’ll let candidates know if they have longer to respond to an offer and tell them their new DBD date.

## What we ask of you during this time

### Keep your vacancy statuses up to date

Please update the statuses of your training programmes to tell potential applicants if you’re not recruiting at the moment.

Providers in England can do this using [Publish teacher training courses](https://www.publish-teacher-training-courses.service.gov.uk/).
