## For candidates

### Recent changes

* Encouraged candidates to showcase their skills and achievements by [adding a full work history](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/apply-for-teacher-training/work-history-iteration/)

* Improved guidance around qualification requirements to encourage candidates to add A levels to their application

* Improved the information candidates see about the progress of their application after submitting their application

* Showing candidates where they can improve their application based on feedback from providers on previous applications, for example if they need to improve their personal statement

* Signposting the teacher training adviser service more effectively so that unsuccessful candidates can access the support they need to be successful in future

### Working on now

* Improving how location-based search works on Find postgraduate teacher training to help candidates find courses near them

## For providers

### Recent changes

* Collection of structured reasons when withdrawing an offer or when an application is rejected by default

* Enabled filtering a list of applications by subject

* Allow providers to make unconditional offers at stage 1, with support in the API

### Working on now

* Enable providers to receive appropriate and useful email notifications

* Enable providers to [customise which email notifications they receive](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/managing-individual-email-notifications/)

* Withdrawing applications that candidates have decided to withdraw instead of rejecting them or leaving them to be rejected by default

* [Withdrawing applications at candidatesâ€™ request](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/manage-teacher-training-applications/withdrawing-an-application-iteration-2/)

* Offering PE with EBacc to exceptional candidates instead of opening a new course on Publish

* Management information (MI) - Allow providers to view their collated application information so that they can analyse trends and gain insight into their own recruitment processes

* Permissions - Enable providers to have increased flexibility when setting up permissions within their organisation and with their partner organisation
