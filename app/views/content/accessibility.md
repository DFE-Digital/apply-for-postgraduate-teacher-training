## How accessible this website is

Apply for teacher training is a new service being developed by the Department for Education. It allows people to apply to some teacher training courses in England.

The service is being trialled with a limited number of users.

However, it is designed to be accessible for as many people as possible. We have built it in line with the [accessible design principles used across GOV.UK](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/).

During development we tested the prototype with users with accessibility needs, for instance, users who require screen readers.

We are planning to improve the accessibility of this service as we test and develop it.
