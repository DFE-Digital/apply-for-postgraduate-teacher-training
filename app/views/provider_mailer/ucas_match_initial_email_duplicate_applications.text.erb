Dear <%= @provider_user_name %>

<%= @application_form.full_name %> has applied to study <%= @course_name_and_code %> at <%= @provider_name %> through both DfE Apply for teacher training and UCAS Teacher Training Apply.

We’re letting you know so that you do not process their application twice.

# What we’ve done

We’ve contacted the candidate and asked them to withdraw their application from one of the services by <%= @withdraw_by_date %>.

We’ve told them that their UCAS application will be automatically withdrawn if they do not withdraw from one of the services.

# What will happen next

We’ll send you an email once the duplicate application has been withdrawn. We’ll tell you which service it has been withdrawn from.

You can review the candidate’s application in the meantime.
