Dear <%= @provider_user_name %>

<%= @application_form.full_name %> has applied to <%= @course_name_and_code %> on both DfE Apply for teacher training and UCAS Teacher Training Apply.

We’re letting you know so you recognise this is a duplicate and you do not process this application twice.

# Next steps

We’ve contacted the candidate and asked them to withdraw their application from one of the services within 10 working days. If they have not acted within 10 working days, their course choice will be deleted from their UCAS application.

In the meantime, you can review the candidate’s application.

We’ll send you an email once the duplicate application has been deleted.


You do not have to do anything, but if you have any questions you can get in touch with us by contacting [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk).

Sincerely,

The Department for Education & UCAS
