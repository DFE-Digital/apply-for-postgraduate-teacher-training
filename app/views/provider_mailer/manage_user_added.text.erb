Dear <%= @provider_user.full_name || 'colleague' %>


# Changes to your permissions settings on Manage teacher training applications

Your organisation has given you ‘Manage users’ permission. This allows you to:

* set permissions for team members
* invite new users
* delete users

You'll be able to use your new permissions next time you sign in:

<%= provider_interface_sign_in_url %>


# Help and support

To get help setting and amending permissions for your team members, email us at [becomingateacher@digital education.gov.uk](becomingateacher@digital education.gov.uk).
