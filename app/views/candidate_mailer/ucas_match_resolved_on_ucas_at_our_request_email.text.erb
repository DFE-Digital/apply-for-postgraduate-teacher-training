Dear <%= @application_form.full_name %>

You applied to study <%= @course_name_and_code %> at <%= @provider_name %> through both GOV.UK and UCAS.

You can only continue through one of the services, so we’ve withdrawn your application through UCAS.

We’ve told <%= @provider_name %> that you’re applying through GOV.UK.

# Track your application

You can track your application through GOV.UK:
