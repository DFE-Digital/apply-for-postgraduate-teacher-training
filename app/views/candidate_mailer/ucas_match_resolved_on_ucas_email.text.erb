Dear <%= @application_form.full_name %>

We’ve written to you a couple of times as we noticed you applied to study  <%= @course_name_and_code %> at <%= @provider_name %> on both Apply for teacher training and UCAS Teacher Training Apply – which isn’t allowed.

As you didn’t withdraw the choice, as requested, we have removed it from your UCAS application meaning you should use Apply for teacher training to track the progress of your application for [course name and code].

Any other courses you applied to have not been affected.

We informed <%= @provider_name %> that the course choice was removed from your UCAS application.

If you have any questions, get in touch with us by contacting [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk).

Sincerely,

The Department for Education & UCAS
