Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# Update on your application

<%= @course.provider.name %> has decided not to make you an offer to study <%= @course.name_and_code %>.
They've given feedback to explain this decision.

<% @application_choice.rejection_reasons.each_pair do |title, reasons| %>

^ # <%=  title %>

   <% reasons.each do |reason| %>
    ^ <%= reason %>
    ^
    <% end %>
  <% end %>


Contact <%= @course.provider.name %> directly if you have any questions about their feedback.


# You can apply again

<% if @multiple_applications %>
  Youâ€™ve now had decisions about all the courses you applied for. You did not get any offers, so you can apply again.
<% end %>

Your last application has been saved. You can make changes before you submit your new application.
