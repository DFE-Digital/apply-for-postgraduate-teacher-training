Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# Application decision

<%= @course.provider.name %> has decided not to progress your teacher training application for <%= @course.name_and_code %> on this occasion.

# You may still be able to get a place on a course

Your <%= @application_form.application_choices.count > 1 ? 'provider has' : 'providers have' %> left you some feedback. There may be things you can do to get a place on a course this year, next year or in the future.

Review your feedback:

# Applying again this year

If now’s the right time for you, it’s easy to apply again this year. We’ve saved your last application, so all you have to do is sign in, choose a course, make any changes and submit.
