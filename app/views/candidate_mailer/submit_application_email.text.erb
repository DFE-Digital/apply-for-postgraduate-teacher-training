# References

The Apply for teacher training service will now contact your referees to ask them for references.

Your referees will be given a short questionnaire about you and a free text box to describe you in their own words. They will not be given access to your completed application form.

We will send a reminder email to your referees after 5 days. If we haven’t heard back from them after 10 days, or they refuse to give a reference, we’ll get back in touch with you to ask for a replacement.

# Interview

Most training providers don’t reach a decision about your interview until they’ve seen references.

# Application decision

Your training provider will respond to your application within 40 working days via email. If they decide to progress your application, they will communicate with you directly to organise an interview date and give you all the information you need.
