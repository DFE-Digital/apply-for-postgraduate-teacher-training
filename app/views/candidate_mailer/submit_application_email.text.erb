<% end %>

Your application reference is <%= @application_form.support_reference %>.

# Making changes to your application

<% if FeatureFlag.active?('edit_application') %>
  You have <%= TimeLimitConfig.limits_for(:edit_by).first.limit %> working days to edit your application or change your choice of provider, course or training location.

  To make changes, [sign back in to your account](<%= candidate_sign_in_url(@candidate) %>).

  You can sign back in to change your name or contact details at any point up until enrolment.

  We’ll pass any changes on to the training <%= 'provider'.pluralize(@application_form.application_choices.count) %>.
<% else %>
  Get in touch with us as soon as possible if you need to make any amends, as we only have 5 working days to make changes.

  For example, you can add more courses (if you haven’t reached your limit of 3) or change your course choices.

  Once we’ve processed your request, we won’t be able to make any more changes for you.

  However, you can ask us to update your name or contact details at any point up until enrolment.

  Contact us at [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk) if you need to make changes.

# Withdrawing your application

You can withdraw your application to your <%= 'course'.pluralize(@application_form.application_choices.count) %> at any point, even after you’ve accepted an offer.

Sign in to your account and click ‘withdraw’ next to the course(s) you want to withdraw:

# References

We’ve contacted your referees. If we don’t hear back from them within 10 days, or they choose not to give a reference, we’ll ask you for a replacement.

Your application won’t be sent to your provider until your references are in.

# Application decision

If your training provider decides to progress your application, they’ll contact you directly to organise an interview date.

They should make a decision on whether to make an offer within <%= TimeLimitConfig.limits_for(:reject_by_default).first.limit %> working days of receiving your application.
