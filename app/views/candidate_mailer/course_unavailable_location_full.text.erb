Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# There are no more places at your location

There are no more places at <%= @application_choice.course_option.site.name %> for <%= @application_choice.course_option.course.name_and_code %> at <%= @application_choice.course_option.course.provider.name %>.

The places filled up while we were waiting for your references, so the provider has not got your application.

# Update your course choice now

Find out about other options for <%= @application_choice.course_option.course.name_and_code %> and edit or replace the course choice:

<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>

If you do nothing, we’ll send your application to the provider when your references come in. There’s no guarantee they’ll consider it.
