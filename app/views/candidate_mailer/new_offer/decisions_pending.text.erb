Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# You have an offer

You have an offer from <%= @provider_name %> to study <%= @course_name %>.

The provider has set the following condition(s):

<% @conditions.each do |condition| %>
  - <%= condition %>
<% end %>

Contact <%= @provider_name %> if you have any questions about this.

# Next steps

^You can wait to hear back about your other application(s) before making a decision. When the last decision is in, you’ll have 10 working days to respond.

^Or

^You can respond to the offer now. If you accept the offer, your other teacher training application(s) will be withdrawn. Sign in to your account if you want to respond:

<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_choice.application_form.candidate) %>

# What to do if you’re unable to start training in <%= @start_date %>

Some teacher training providers allow you to defer your offer. This means that you could start your course a year later.

Every provider is different, so it may or may not be possible to do this. Find out by contacting <%= @provider_name %>.

Asking if it’s possible to defer will not affect your existing offer.

If <%= @provider_name %> agrees to defer your offer, you’ll need to accept the offer on your account first.
