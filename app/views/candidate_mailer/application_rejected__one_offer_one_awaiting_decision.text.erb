Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# Update on your application

<% if @application_choice.rejected_by_default %>

Your application to study <%= @course.name_and_code %> has been automatically rejected because <%= @course.provider.name %> did not make a decision before today’s deadline.

<% else %>

<%= @course.provider.name %> has decided not to make you an offer to study <%= @course.name_and_code %>.
They've given feedback to explain this decision.

<% @application_choice.rejection_reasons.each_pair do |title, reasons| %>

^ # <%=  title %>

   <% reasons.each do |reason| %>
    ^ <%= reason %>
    ^
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

<% end %>


Contact <%= @course.provider.name %> directly if you have any questions about their feedback.
