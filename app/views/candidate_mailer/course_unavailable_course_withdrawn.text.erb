Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# Your course is not running anymore

<%= @application_choice.course_option.course.provider.name %> is not running <%= @application_choice.course_option.course.name_and_code %> anymore.

The provider removed the course while we were waiting for your references, so they have not got your application.

# Decide what you want to do and let us know as soon as possible

Email us at [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk) to let us know what you want to do.

You can:
- choose a different course (go to https://www.find-postgraduate-teacher-training.service.gov.uk to find a course)
- remove the course from your application
- keep the course on your application

If you do nothing, we’ll send your application to the provider when your references come in. There’s no guarantee they’ll consider it.
