Dear <%= @application_form.first_name %>,

# Your course is not running anymore

<%= @application_choice.course_option.course.provider.name %> is not running <%= @application_choice.course_option.course.name_and_code %> anymore.

The provider removed the course while we were waiting for your references, so they have not got your application.

# Update course choice now

Update your course choice:

<%= candidate_magic_link(@application_form.candidate) %>

If you do nothing, we’ll send your application to the provider when your references come in. There’s no guarantee they’ll consider it.
