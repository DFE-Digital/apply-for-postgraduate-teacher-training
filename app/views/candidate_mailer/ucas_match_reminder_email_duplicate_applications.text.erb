Dear <%= @application_form.full_name %>

Further to our email on <%= @initial_email_date %>, we’ve noticed you’ve applied to study <%= @course_name_and_code %> at <%= @provider_name %> on both DfE Apply for teacher training and UCAS Teacher Training Apply – which isn’t allowed.

# What you need to do

You need to withdraw the choice from one of the systems to ensure you’re not applying twice.

It’s up to you which system you choose to progress the choice on. If you have additional UCAS Teacher Training choices, you may want to keep the choice on UCAS Teacher Training Track, so all your choices are in one place.

# What happens if you don’t do anything?

If you don’t withdraw your duplicate choice by <%= @request_ucas_withdrawal_date %> (5 working days), we will withdraw the choice from your UCAS Teacher Training application – meaning you’ll use DfE Apply for teacher training to progress this choice.

If you have any questions, get in touch with us by contacting [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk).

Sincerely,

The Department for Education & UCAS
