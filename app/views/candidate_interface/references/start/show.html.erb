    <p class="govuk-body">Referees should not be family members, partners or friends.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you graduated in the last 5 years, or you do not yet have a grade for your degree, choose at least one academic referee.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you’re applying for a salaried course, one of your references must be from an employer.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Training providers will only accept a character reference if there’s also an academic or professional reference.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can add as many referees as you like to increase the chances of getting 2 references quickly.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contact your referees</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Contact your referees in advance to check that they can submit a reference quickly online.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Check that they can give you a full reference and not just confirm the dates you worked there. Providers need to know if you're suitable to become a teacher.</p>
