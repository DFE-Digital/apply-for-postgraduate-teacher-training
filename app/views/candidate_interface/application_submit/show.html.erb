          As prospective teachers, all candidates must consent to an enhanced DBS
          check. This will show up any past criminal convictions, both spent and
          unspent. Some convictions, even if they are spent, will disbar you from
          teaching.
        </p>
        However, not all past convictions prevent you from training to be a teacher.
        Talk to your provider about their policy on criminal convictions.
