Dear <%= @name %>,

We recently sent you an email about the new Apply for teacher training service. We invited you to take part in some research and offered to pay £100 in return for your time.

We’re not sure if you saw the message because we didn’t hear back from you. If you don’t remember seeing the email, please check your junk folder in case it’s gone there.

We’d love to hear what you think about the service. To take part in our research and claim the £100 incentive, go to <%= t('survey_emails.survey_link') %>
