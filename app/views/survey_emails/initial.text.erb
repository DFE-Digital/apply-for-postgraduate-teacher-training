Dear <%= @name %>,

<%= @thank_you_message %>

As you’re one of the first users of our new service, we’d love to hear about your experience. We’re paying £100 to those willing to take part.

This research will be in two stages:

1) You fill in a short survey (most people complete it in under 5 minutes).

2) Once you’ve completed the survey, we’ll follow up with a phone call to talk about your responses.

To take part, go to <%= t('survey_emails.survey_link') %>

Once you’re finished, we’ll contact you to confirm payment.

If you have any questions about our service or our research, please get in touch by emailing [becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk](mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk)
