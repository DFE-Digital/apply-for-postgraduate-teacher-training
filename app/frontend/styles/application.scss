// Because candidates might not remember which day they started a particular job
// on, we shouldn't ask them for this information. However, govuk_design_system_formbuilder
// doesn't support this particular edge-case, so we need to work around it.
// By setting display: none; this field becomes invisible to screen readers.
// It doesn't need to be filled in, because it will be initialised with 1.
